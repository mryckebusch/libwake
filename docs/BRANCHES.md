# Branch policy

`main` is the only long-lived branch. Everything else is a short-lived work
branch that dies at merge.

## main

- CI on `main` is green (`commit-msg`, `test`, `san`, `tsan`,
  `diffuzz-arch`).
- No merge commits. Squash or rebase only.
- Squash uses the PR title as the subject and the PR body as Why / Proof /
  Contract (`docs/COMMIT.md`).
- The head branch is deleted on merge.
- Force-push and deletion of `main` are forbidden. Where the hosting plan
  allows a branch ruleset, that ruleset enforces it; the commit hook, CI, and
  this file are the gate regardless.

## Work branches

Name:

```
<type>/<scope>-<slug>
```

`<type>` and `<scope>` are the same closed lists as `docs/COMMIT.md`.
`<slug>` is lowercase ASCII, hyphens, at most 40 characters.

Examples: `fix/match-re-compile`, `feat/corr-window-cap`,
`build/github-issue-forms`.

One branch, one PR, one concern. Do not stack unrelated work.

## Tags

`vN` (or `N.N.N`) is a human release. Tags are not rewritten.

## Automated contributors

Automated contributors do not create or push `main`, do not tag, and do not
choose a branch name outside the pattern above. See `AGENTS.md`.
