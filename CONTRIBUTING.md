# Contributing

## Commits

`docs/COMMIT.md` is the contract. It is not optional. Install the
hook before you commit:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
git config commit.template .gitmessage
```

PRs squash-merge. The PR title is the subject. The PR body is Why /
Proof / Contract. CI runs `scripts/check-commit-msg.sh` on every
commit in the PR and will reject a squash that does not match.

## Branches

`docs/BRANCHES.md`. Work branches are `<type>/<scope>-<slug>` with
the same type and scope lists as commits. `main` is not a work
branch.

## Issues

Use the Bug or Build form. Security reports go to
jeremie.jourdin@advens.fr, not the tracker.

## Code

C11, 4 spaces, K&R, snake_case, no VLA. Dual-arch (amd64 SSE4.2,
aarch64 NEON, scalar fallback). `make -f Makefile.port test` and
`make -f Makefile.port san` before you ask for merge.

Do not send YAML parsing, host-integration glue, or network code here.

## Releasing

`docs/RELEASING.md`, for whoever is cutting the next tag.
